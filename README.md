# SantaFeTrailNeuralNet
Attempt to solve SantaFe Ant Trail with Reinforcement Learning

SantaFe Ant Trail is a well know test problem for genetic algorithms
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe_Trail_problem

This is an attempt to solve it using a reinforcement neural network

First draft is up, 
Still needs biases, probably different activation ( Relu ), gradient, and maybe some reward tweaking.

This is in Python and Numpy to make it easier to understand code and use as a toy problem

Work in progress, planning another pass, or more, on this problem and smarter networks.
