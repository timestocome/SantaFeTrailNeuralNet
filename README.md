# SantaFeTrailNeuralNet
Attempt to solve SantaFe Ant Trail with Reinforcement Learning

SantaFe Ant Trail is a well know test problem for genetic algorithms
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe_Trail_problem

This is an attempt to solve it using a reinforcement neural network
http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/

First draft is up, 
Still needs biases, probably different activation ( Relu ), gradient, and maybe some reward tweaking.

This is in Python and Numpy to make it easier to understand code and use as a toy problem

Work in progress, planning another pass, or more, on this problem and smarter networks.

Working through https://github.com/dennybritz/reinforcement-learning/blob/master/DP/Policy%20Evaluation.ipynb
and adapting it to the SantaFe Ant Trail Problem as I go through the examples.

Using Sutton's 'Reinforcement Learning'
