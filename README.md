# SantaFeTrailNeuralNet
Attempt to solve SantaFe Ant Trail with Reinforcement Learning

SantaFe Ant Trail is a well know test problem for genetic algorithms
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe_Trail_problem


This is an attempt to first solve it using a reinforcement neural network
http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/
This is in Python and Numpy to make it easier to understand code and use as a toy problem


Second pass working through https://github.com/dennybritz/reinforcement-learning/blob/master/DP/Policy%20Evaluation.ipynb and  Sutton's 'Reinforcement Learning' http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/ebook/the-book.html
and adapting their examples to the SantaFe Ant Trail Problem.
